# HealthCare

Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. We as human focus just on our physical health. Unfortunately, in most parts of the world, mental health and mental disorders are not accorded anywhere the same importance as physical health.Rather, they have been largely ignored or neglected.Mental Disorder, if not taken care of ,can lead to 
disability 
Permanent memory loss
manipulation or even self harm

This system would help an individual to overcome his mental disorder by exploring parameters like tracking anxiety levels, stress levels and physical and mental tiredness.
